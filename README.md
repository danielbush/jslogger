# JSLogger - a standalone logging facility for the browser

See example.html and example-deferred.html for examples.

"deferred" refers to the fact that you can instantiate the logger and
start logging before document.body is available.

Logger is intended to be fairly basic, self-contained javascript object that
allows other programs/objects to print output onto it.
By being self-contained, Logger does not have to rely on any other javascript
libraries for its functionality.

Logger uses the packaging and namespacing standard specified in README.modules.html.
The latest version can be found at:
<http://js.web17.com.au/specs/packaging-and-namespacing/index.xhtml> .
