Subject: Logger - introduction

Main project contact:
  dlb.id.au (AT) gmail.com

See example.html for examples.
Logger is intended to be fairly basic, self-contained javascript object that
allows other programs/objects to print output onto it.
By being self-contained, Logger does not have to rely on any other javascript
libraries for its functionality.

Logger uses the packaging and namespacing standard specified in README.modules.html.
The latest version can be found at:
