   <h2>Abstract</h2>
   <p>
    The Packaging and Namespacing for Javascript Projects Standard is a set of conventions
    intended to allow javascript programmers to safely use javascript libraries from multiple
    vendors in the one project and package such a project so that it too can be safely
    used by other projects in turn.
   </p>
   <p>The following questions motivate this standard.</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     What is the best way to structure a javascript project?
    </li>
    <li>
     How do you package it and handle versioning?
    </li>
    <li>
     How do you prevent clashes in the javascript "global namespace" when using multiple
     javascript libraries from diverse sources?
    </li>
    <li>
     In short: how do you create a system of javascript libraries created
     by multiple authors/vendors with multiple versions which other authors can
     easily use and handle in a reliable, controlled way?
    </li>
   </ul>

   <h2>1 Terminology</h2>
   <p>
   We identify the key parts of a javascript project and related processes.
   We highlight the key problems and issues that arise as we define these parts.
   </p>
   <dl>
    <dt>
     Publisher
    </dt>
    <dd>
     A person or organisation who creates javascript code as an application or
     as a library to be used by other javascript applications by other
     publishers or the same publisher.
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Global Namespace (GN)
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
     A global variable that publishers use to contain all projects they produce.
     A GN is a javascript object:
     </p>
     <pre>
      var $GN$ = {}; 
     </pre>
     <p>
     The GN might be a descriptive name representing the publisher, the publisher's
     company or domain name.  <b>This document will make recommendations regarding
     the format used for the GN (including the use of the dollar signs) to reduce
     the chance of different publishers using the same GN.</b>
     </p><p>
     A project makes use of a GN by occupying one of the entries of the GN object.
     </p>
     <pre>
      $GN$.project1 = {};
     </pre>
     <p>
     The publisher has freedom to create namespaces and to structure their namespace
     as they require.
     </p>
     <pre>
      $GN$.namespace1.project1 = {};
     </pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Foreign Global Namespace (FGN)
    </dt>
    <dd>
     An FGN is a GN of another publisher from the point of view of a given publisher.
     In the following, we'll often just refer to "GN" for a project regardless
     of whether it is using another project or being used by another project.
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Project
    </dt>
    <dd>
     Has the following features:
     <ul>
      <li>
       exists as a set of files and subdirectories under a root directory
      </li>
      <li>
       unminified/unserialised; project may be spread across several files and
       include comments and spacing for human readability as well as additional
       files that aren't executed.
      </li>
      <li>
       is version controlled using a version control system (VCS)
      </li>
      <li>
       defines/creates one place in the GN of the publisher eg 
       <pre>
         $GN$.project1
       </pre>
       OR
       <pre>
         $GN$.area1.project1
       </pre>
       etc 
      </li>
      <li>
       may have dependencies on other projects in the same GN or in FGN's
      </li>
      <li>
       may be used as a dependency (library) or standalone
      </li>
      <li>
       is intended to be packaged - see 'Package' below
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
     A project can be built out of other projects.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Dependency
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A project which another project relies on for some of its functionality.
     Dependencies are usually packaged and as a result, represent a specific
     version or snapshot of the project. Dependencies may be sourced from the
     same GN or an FGN.
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Dependency Chain
    </dt>
    <dd>
      A tree representing the dependencies of a project where the root node 
      represents the project and level 1 represents the libraries
      that the project depends on. Each successive level represents 
      dependencies required by the preceding level.  Here is an example:
     <pre>
          B1
         /
      A--
         \
          C1--B2 
     </pre>
     <p>
     In this diagram, A,B,C are projects. B1,C1,B2 are specific versions of the
     projects B,C and B. <b>Note: Although B1 and B2 are potentially different
     versions of the same project, they both occupy the same location of the GN
     for that project.  The last version to be loaded will therefore occupy this
     position in the GN once the dependency chain has been fully loaded into
     the system.</b>
     </p><p>
     Level 1 of the tree represents A's dependencies (B1 and C1). The
     dependencies of A's dependencies are called 2nd order dependencies of A and
     occupy level 2 of the tree (B2).
     </p><p>
     Note: 'A' may be tagged version in a VCS or an in-between development
     version. Either way, any given snapshot of A relies on specific versions of
     its dependencies.
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Load Order
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
     The order in which a project and its dependencies (and their dependencies
     etc) are loaded.  Load order can be defined recursively. A project loads
     itself by first loading its dependencies in a specified order (see
     packaging) and then loading itself.  Loading involves the process of
     defining the GN if it does not exist already, and then building the
     relevant part of the GN namespace that is defined by the project or
     dependency. Using the dependency chain example above, the appropriate load
     orders are:
     </p>
     <pre>
      B1 B2 C1 A 
     </pre>
     Or:
     <pre>
      B2 C1 B1 A 
     </pre>
     <p>
     <u>Load order is affected by the order in which the packages are referenced
     using script tags in an html file.</u>
     The order would look something like this:
     </p>
     <pre class="small" ><![CDATA[
       <script type="text/javascript" src="/dependencies/projectB-v1.js" ></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="/dependencies/projectC-v1.js" ></script>
       <script type="text/javascript" src="/dependencies/projectA.js" ></script> ]]>
     </pre>
     <p>
     Notes:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>In practice, these files would probably be merged with project A to form one file
     to reduce the number of http requests.</li>
      <li>B2 (projectB-v2.js) is not show as it is part of projectC-v1.js .</li>
     </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
     Load Time
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
     The time during which the project and its dependencies are loaded into the
     interpreter. Can be thought of as the initialization phase of the project.
     This is emphasized because it is during this phase that clashes with
     project global variables may occur.  (Sometimes referred to as 'load order
     time'.)
     </p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Package / Packaging
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
     When a project is "packaged" it becomes a package.  Packages have the
     following features:
     </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
       usually minified; comments and spacing of the original project code are
       reduced or removed
      </li>
      <li>
       usually a single file (serialised)
      </li>
      <li>
       usually represent a particular tagged version of the project (usually
       using a tag in a VCS).
      </li>
      <li>
       may include dependencies
      </li>
      <li>
       javascript files of the project have to be serialised in load order when
       creating the single package file
      </li>
      <li>
       The version number is explicity added to the end of the file. Eg
       project1-0.2.js would be version 0.2 of project1.
      </li>
     </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Module
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      A module (also referred to as the "module pattern") is a pattern
     identified by Yahoo!. See:
     <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/"
     >http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/06/12/module-pattern/</a>. <b>Modules can be
     used to construct a part of a GN or project at load time and encourage the
     building of projects and their dependencies outside of the global namespace.</b> 
     </p><p>
     Key aspects of a module are
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li>the module is scoped by a function</li>
      <li>this scope is created at load time</li>
      <li>dependencies (ie other modules from other projects) can be loaded within
       this scope at load time via a simple local variable assignment
       <b>allowing the publisher to ensure a specific dependency for this
       module is not overwritten by a different version at a later point in the
       load order.</b></li>
     </ol>
    </dd>
    <dt>
     Frameworks
    </dt>
    <dd>
     <p>
      Frameworks are large, overarching sets of projects or libraries. Examples
     are jQuery and Prototype. Frameworks tend to use their own special GN's eg
     jQuery uses 'jQuery'; or occupy really common GN's eg Prototype uses
     'Event', 'Ajax' etc. 
     </p><p>
     Frameworks are mostly exempt from this document.
     </p><p>
     If you are using one, it will probably be included at the top of the load
     order. Projects and dependencies in the rest of the load order can then use
     the framework. It is up to the publisher to make sure they use an
     appropriate version of the framework to fit the requirements of the project
     and its dependencies.

   <h2>
    2 Conventions
   </h2>
   <div>
    <h3>
     2.1 Referencing global variables
    </h3>
    <p>
    Do NOT reference global variables in yet-to-be-executed function eg an
    asynchronous event handler.  This includes referencing the GN or part of the
    GN or any other global variable that is a shortcut to the GN or part of the
    GN.
    </p><p>
    Global variables should be accessed at load time and preferably with a local
    variable within the scope of a module.
    </p><p>
    Rationale:
    </p><p>
    You cannot guarantee that the same version of a project is accesible through
    the GN after load time, because another project/dependency may have
    overloaded it through their dependencies. For shortcuts, the situation can
    be exacerbated; several dependencies (projects) may use the same shortcut to
    reference completely different things. If these shortcuts are global these
    shortcuts will get corrupted.
    </p><p>
    Example: 
    <pre>
      var project1 = $GN$.area1.project1;
      project1.Object1 = function(){...}
      var p = new project1.Object(); 
    </pre>
     In this example, 'project1' is a global variable shortcut to a GN which is
    set up and then used straight away. Note: the above example should not be
    used for projects which are likely to be used as dependencies themselves as
    it is polluting the global namespace. See next point.
    </p><p>
    Example - bad: 
    <pre>
      var project1 = $GN$.area1.project1;
      function doSomethingLater() {
      ...
      var obj = new project1.Object1();
      ...
      } 
    </pre>
    </p><p>
    In this example, the 'doSomethingLater' function is not executed but
    references a global shortcut 'project1'. In an environment that has multiple
    dependencies from multiple authors, the 'project1' could be overwritten by
    another dependency at load time and is not guaranteed to be correct. Even if
    we don't use a shortcut, it is possible that $GN$.area1.project1 has been
    overwritten with a different version.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h3>
     2.2 Using modules to build the GN and to reference other GN's
    </h3>
    <p>
    If your project is intended or likely to be used as a dependency (a library
    to some other project), then i) it should be constructed using a module (at
    load time) and ii) the GN's of its dependencies should be referenced inside
    this module. Shortcuts to such GN's should be created within the scope of
    the module at or near the top.
    </p><p>
    Rationale:
    </p><p>
    A dependency which has other dependencies, will reference them in its module
    that builds that dependency at load time thus ensuring that the dependency
    has kept a reference to the appropriate version .
    </p><p>
    Example:
    <pre>
     $GN1$.project1 = function() {
      ...
      var project2 = $GN2$.area1.project2;
      ...
      ...
      ...
     }(); 
    </pre>
    </p><p>
    In this example, project2 is a dependency of project1 and is referenced
    within the executed scope of the anonymous function. Assuming load order and
    packaging have been set up properly, this should ensure that project1 is
    using the appropriate version of project2.
    </p><p>
    Note: Use of this technique within the context of the load order may
    mitigate any clashes in the GN; but it still makes sense to keep GN's unique
    to clearly distinguish publishers.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div>
    <h3>
     2.3 GN naming scheme
    </h3>
    <p>
    Use double dollar sign to denote a GN. The string between the dollar signs
    should represent a domain name of the publisher with the dots replaced by
    underscores. eg $web17_com_au$ would represent the GN for the publisher who
    owns the web17.com.au domain name.
    </p><p>
    Rationale:
    </p><p>
    If there are a proliferation of publishers creating javascript projects and
    libraries that can be used by other publishers, the likelihood of the same
    GN being used by different publishers increases; a modified domain name will
    reduce this risk. 
    </p><p>
    The dollar signs signify that the variable is a GN and is part of the
    packaging system rather than just another variable in a program. 
    </p><p>
    It also encourages the use of shortcuts. The GN should not be interspersed
    throughout the code in the project. It should be referenced by a shortcut at
    the top of a module or project.
    </p>
    <h4>
     2.3.1 Starting a GN
    </h4>
    <p>
    To start a GN, do:
    </p>
    <pre>
     var $GN$ = $GN$ || {}; 
    </pre>
    <p>
    This statement should be outside of any function. You do not create FGN's. By
    definition, they have been created for you by the dependency.
    </p>
   </div>

   <a name="app-A" ></a>
   <h2>
    A. Module Format
   </h2>
   <p>
   A suggested module pattern is shown below.
   $GN$ and 'project1' are used to represent and example GN and project
   respectively.  
   </p>
   <pre>
    $GN$.project1 = function() {
     var module={};
     var shortcut1 = $FGN1$.path.to.project.Object1;
     var shortcut2 = $FGN2$.path.to.project2;
     ...
     // Private module members.
     var private_var1 = ...;
     ...
     // Public module members.
     module.Object1 = function(...) {...}
     module.function1 = function(...) {...}
     ...
     // Return 'module' to build $GN$.project1 namespace.
     return module;
    }(); 
    </pre>
    <p>
    Notes:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
       We create a local object called 'module' which we return at the end of 
       the module scope.  This object contains the publicly accessible parts of
       the module.
     </li>
     <li>
       We reference 2 FGN's by assigning them to shortcut variables 'shortcut1' and
       'shortcut2'.  Even if the FGN is reloaded with a different version of a project
       later in the load order, we will still hold references to the originals.
     </li>
     <li>
       Don't forget to execute the module as shown on the last line.
     </li>
    </ul>
   <h3>
    A.1 Extending modules - submodules
   </h3>
   Suppose you have built the module in point 2). You can extend the module
   (maybe in a separate file) likeso:
   <pre>
    $GN$.project1.area1 = function() {
     ...
    }(); 
    </pre>
   Notes:
   <ul>
    <li>
     this file would need to come after the first file defining $GN$.project1 at
     load time
    </li>
    <li>
     A new module is being created at project1.area1 - ie a submodule; this
     module clearly cannot see any private data in the parent module.
    </li>
    <li>
     care needs to be taken that area1 doesn't overwrite a namesake defined in
     the project1 module1.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <pre>
    $GN$.project1 = function() {
     ...
    }
    $GN$.project1.Object2 = function() {
     var shortcut1 = $FGN1$.project2; // Not so good.
     ...
    } 
   </pre>
   In this example, the project1 module is augmented with a new object not a
   submodule.  An attempt is made to create a shortcut within Object2.
   Unfortunately, this object can be instantiated at a later time when
   $FGN1$.project2 might have been overwritten with a different version.
   Granted, this is probably not that likely.
   <br/>
   <a name="app-B" ></a>
   <h2>
    B. Layout of project
   </h2>
   The following might represent the file structure for a project on a file system:
   <pre>
    /
    /ext
    /ext/projectA-0.2.js
    /ext/projectB-1.1.2.js
    /globals.js
    ...
    /module1
    /module1/module1.js
    /module1/submodule1.js
    /module1/submodule2.js
    ...
    /module2/module2.js
    ...  
   </pre>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The above layout uses a directory called 'ext' to store dependencies - ie
     other projects are used by this project.
    </li>
    <li>
     The dependencies are packaged with their version numbers displayed so it
     obvious to the maintainer.
    </li>
    <li>
     The globals.js file sets up the $GN$ for the project including the relevant
     part of the $GN$ which this project will handle. Eg 
     <pre>
      var $GN$ = $GN$ || {};
      $GN$.module1={}; // Initialize the module for this project.  
     </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
     A large project might create several modules and submodules; it may make
     sense to provide a subdirectory for each module and its submodules.
    </li>
   </ul>
</div>
