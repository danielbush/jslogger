subject: TODO list - partly prioritized
from: Daniel Bush

1. Get Logger working in IE where it is needed most.
This should become version 0.1.

2. Setup logger to work within a foreign project namespace.
Suppose we have namespace project1 for a project:
eg
   project1.section1.someObject1
   project1.someObject2
would represent some of the items living in this project.
Now suppose we want to use Logger in this project.
Rather than have Logger live as a global object 'Logger',
we'd prefer to have it subsumed into the project.
So we'd have something like:
   project1.external.logger.Logger
and:
   var myLogger = new project1.external.logger.Logger('log for something');

3. Tab interface.
We can instantiate multiple loggers.  However, in its current
form, we'd end up with multiple logger divs cluttering up the
window space.
Instead we should have a central logger frame with tabs on it.
Clicking on a tag will display the contents of that log.

4. Resize or 100% width expansion
It would be handy to be able to view the log using most of the 
screen on occasions.
