1. Get Logger working in IE where it is needed most.
This should become version 0.1.

2. Tab interface.
We can instantiate multiple loggers.  However, in its current
form, we'd end up with multiple logger divs cluttering up the
window space.
Instead we should have a central logger frame with tabs on it.
Clicking on a tag will display the contents of that log.
