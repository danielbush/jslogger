Subject: Logger - introduction

Main project contact:
  dlb.id.au (AT) gmail.com

See example.html for examples.
Logger is intended to be fairly basic, self-contained javascript object that allows other
programs/objects to print output onto it.
By self-contained, we mean it does not to rely on any other javascript libraries
for its functionality.  This doesn't preclude logger from being able to integrate 
with an environment if it is extended to do this.
